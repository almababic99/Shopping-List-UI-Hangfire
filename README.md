# Shopping-List-UI
The task consists of making a simple web application for creating shopping lists for various people. There are a few things we would like the application to do:

- This application would show a pre-populated list of shoppers and shopping items (5 items and 5 shoppers is more than enough).
- User is able to create a shopping list for each user and save it.
- One item can be found in maximum of 3 shopping lists. So the 4th person should not be able to put this item in the list.
- After the lists are saved, user is able to see the created list. This should work for each individual shopper.
